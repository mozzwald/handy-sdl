--------------------------------------
Handy/SDL v0.5 GCC/SDL release INSTALL
--------------------------------------


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

To compile Handy/SDL you need to check if you have the minimum
requirements for compiling the sources:

- GCC v4.3.x or higher
- SDL v1.2.13 or higher
- ZLIB v1.2.3
- OpenGL libraries
- supported OS (BeOS, Linux, FreeBSD and WIN32 through mingw); other OSs
  may work to but you may need to change some items in the Makefile.

Optionally you need a Atari Lynx boot ROM which is available on the Internet. 
We can't include the boot ROM since it's still copyrighted.


COMPILING:
----------

If you sure you have the minimum software requirements, you can compile
Handy/SDL by issuing the following command in the directory where you
decompressed the source:

- Handy/SDL v0.5 using Handy v0.90 sourcebase: make -f Makefile-0.90
- Handy/SDL v0.5 using Handy v0.95 sourcebase: make -f Makefile-0.95

Optionally you can manually strip handy_sdl[.exe] to downsize the binary. If you have
upx in your path somewhere, you can uncomment the line in the makefile that
executes upx so that you'll end up with a somewhat smaller binary.

That's it! You're done! You can now start the emulator with ./handy_sdl. See the
output for more details or consult the README file for more info.
